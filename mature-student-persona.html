			<p><b>Name:</b> Terrence Smildron</p>
			<p><b>Age:</b> 55</p>
			<p><b>Occupation:</b> Small Business Owner</p>
			<p><b>Quote:</b> “Education and hard work are the keys to success.”</p>
			<p><b>Relationship Status:</b> Married</p>
			<p><b>Likes/Dislikes:</b> Terry likes sports, cuisine, current affairs, and has wood-working and model airplanes as his hobbies. He dislikes winter, conservatism, loud noises, and cats.</p>
			<p><b>Dreams/Aspirations:</b> Terry looks forward to a career change, continuing his ethic of life-long learning, and eventual retirement.
			<p>The future mature student section of the Georgian College website is intended to provide prospective mature students with the information they need about Georgian, and to convince them that Georgian College is the right institution for them to continue their education. This section of the website has links that allow mature students to look at Georgian’s different programs, and has other links more useful to mature students like the credit transfer service page, admissions requirements page, one for academic upgrading, and a link to the Ontario Second Career program page.</p>
			<p>As it says on the mature student page, “If you’ll be 19 or older when you start classes (21 for degree programs), you’re a mature student.” As Terry is middle-aged, he is more than qualified based on this criterion. Terry hasn’t been to school for a long time, and has even had a couple careers in his life already.</p>
			<p><b>Use Cases:</b></p>

			<p>Upgrading for current career.</p>
			<p>Personal interest/retirement activity</p>

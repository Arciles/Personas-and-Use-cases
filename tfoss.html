			<p>Xushan moved to Canada less than one year ago and faces language barriers. She earned a Fine Arts degree in China, and is taking Georgian's Graphic Design program to develop digital commercial skills. In choosing a college graphic design program she hopes to put her previous degree and theoretical knowledge to practical use in the workplace, so that she can earn an income. She chose Georgian's program specifically because she has relatives who live in Barrie, and she hopes to establish roots in Canada.</p>
				<p>Xushan's family helps with her finances. She also earns her own income by working part-time with an agency that gets her sporadic freelance design work. She doesn't drive a car and takes a Barrie city bus to college each day.</p>

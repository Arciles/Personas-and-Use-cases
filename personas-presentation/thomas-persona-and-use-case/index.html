			<p><strong>Aspirations &amp; Dreams</strong><br />
Thomas aspires to become a world class chef and own a five star restaurant. He wishes to travel the world before and have a taste of every type of food it has to offer. He then hopes to move back to Canada and open a multi-cultural restaurant and use the knowledge he has gained from his previous experiences.</p>
			<p><strong>Background</strong><br />
Raised in the suburbs of the Greater Toronto area, Thomas acquired the interest of becoming a chef through his parents. Both had attended Culinary school and he believes it is in his blood to do so as well. His family has been apart of the restaurant industry for many years and he wants to continue that legacy.</p>

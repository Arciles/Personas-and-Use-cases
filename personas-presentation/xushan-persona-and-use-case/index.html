			<p>Xushan moved to Canada less than one year ago and faces language barriers. She prefers to go by the name "Susan," to make pronunciation easier for anglophones. She earned a Fine Arts degree in China, and is taking Georgian's Graphic Design program, in part, to develop digital commercial skills for this country; but, perhaps more importantly, to learn English better. In choosing a college graphic design program she hopes to put her previous degree and theoretical knowledge to practical use in the workplace, so that she can earn an income. She came to Barrie specifically because she has relatives who live there, and she hopes to establish roots in Canada.</p>
				<p>Xushan's family helps with her finances. She also earns her own income by working part-time with an agency that gets her sporadic freelance design work. She doesn't drive a car and takes a Barrie city bus to college each day.</p>

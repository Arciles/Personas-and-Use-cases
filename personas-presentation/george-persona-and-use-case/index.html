			<p>George is an electrical engineering technologist at hydro. He has been working there for 6 years. He likes what he does for work but this career path wasn’t his first choice. However he started to like the hydro in time. This job became his life and hobby at the same time. He hates doing chores and talking the neighbour next door. He has a dog and he is planning to get another dog near time in future because he and his girlfriend planning to move a larger and enjoyable house. His biggest dream in his life is visit Europe. He wanted to see Venice and Rome since his teenage years because of city’s historic background and arts.</p>
